## How to connect your project using python and django.
1. This App is made using Python, Django HTML and CSS.
2. Firstly you will need to download Python from official Python website and also install Python on your Pc., if you don't have already.
3. Then you need to open your favorite code editor. I use VSCode. 
4. Once you have opened the code editor, then you need to open the terminal and and install Django command for this is pip install django. Few modules will be downloaded with it. Once the Django is been installed it will give successful message in terminal.
5. Now you will need to create Django project within this project and command for this is "django-admin startproject <'name of the project'>".
6. To see if you are connected with your project to webserver you will need to cd in to the project and then enter the command python manage.py runserver. if it show's the screen with rocket ready to take off, that means you are all set to create your own website.
7. You will also need to create template folder which will include HTML files. After creating template folder you will need to create static folder which will include css files.

## How to build Cryptocurrency App for Bitcoin and Ethereum.
1. To create Cryptocurrency website, you will need to get Api from whichever exchange you decide to use. In this project I have used Coinbase and Gemini. To get the Api for Coinbase and Gemini you will need to go to 'https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#prices' and 'https://docs.gemini.com/rest-api/#ticker' respectively.
2. Once you get the api from these link you will need to get the data which is needed in this project. From coinbase api I have used buying and selling price data. And from gemini api I have used 'ask' and 'bid' which is buying ans selling price respectively.
3. After that you will need to apply logic to tell user, to buy stock from the exchange which has lower price and see the stock through the exchange which has higher price.
4. Then you will need to add styling accordingly. For this project I have used Bootstrap and some my own css. Your project should be ready to go.
